## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I want to highlight my first time using the icon library Font Awesome. Helped to easily handle stylizing icons as if they were fonts in HTML.

### Continued development

I intend to continue focusing on flexbox and clean code for better outcomes.

### Useful resources

- (https://fontawesome.com/) - This helped me for adding social networks icons as fonts to HTML. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
